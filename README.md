# Diabetes Prediction Using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project implements a supervised machine learning model to predict diabetes using Logistic Regression. The model analyzes key medical attributes to estimate the probability of diabetes, demonstrating a complete and interpretable ML pipeline.

## Problem Statement
Early detection of diabetes plays a vital role in preventive healthcare. This project aims to build a binary classification model that predicts whether a patient is diabetic based on diagnostic medical features.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of the following medical attributes:
- Glucose Level  
- Blood Pressure  
- Body Mass Index (BMI)  
- Insulin  
- Age  

## Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Feature selection and scaling  
3. Model training using Logistic Regression  
4. Model evaluation using standard classification metrics  

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-Score  
- Confusion Matrix  

## Results
The Logistic Regression model provides reliable and interpretable predictions, making it a strong baseline for healthcare-related classification problems.
